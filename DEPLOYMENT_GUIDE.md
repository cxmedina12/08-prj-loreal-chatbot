# L'Oréal Chatbot Deployment Guide

## Quick Fixes Applied

The connection test was failing due to several issues that have now been fixed:

### 1. Fixed Issues in `worker.js`:

- ✅ Added proper environment variable access (`globalThis.OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- ✅ Fixed syntax errors (removed extra closing braces)
- ✅ Added API key validation
- ✅ Improved error handling

### 2. Fixed Issues in `wrangler.toml`:

- ✅ Corrected `OPENAI_API_URL` to point to OpenAI's API instead of the worker URL
- ✅ Cleaned up formatting issues

### 3. Enhanced `script.js`:

- ✅ Better error detection and logging
- ✅ Added fallback responses when Worker is unavailable
- ✅ Improved user feedback about connection status

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Install Wrangler CLI

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

### Step 2: Login to Cloudflare

```bash
wrangler login
```

### Step 3: Set up Environment Variables

You need to add your OpenAI API key as a secret:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /workspaces/08-prj-loreal-chatbot

# Add your OpenAI API key as a secret (replace with your actual key)
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
```

When prompted, enter your OpenAI API key.

### Step 4: Deploy the Worker

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

### Step 5: Update the Worker URL

After deployment, Wrangler will show you the deployed URL. Update the `WORKER_URL` in `script.js`:

```javascript
const WORKER_URL = "https://lorealchatbot.cxmedina12.workers.dev/";
```

Replace with your actual deployed URL.

## Testing the Connection

1. Open the browser console (F12)
2. Refresh the page
3. Look for connection test results in the console
4. Try sending a test message

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Test Still Fails?

1. **Worker not deployed**: Run `wrangler deploy`
2. **Wrong URL**: Check that `WORKER_URL` in `script.js` matches your deployed worker
3. **Missing API key**: Run `wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. **CORS issues**: The worker should handle CORS automatically

### Check Worker Logs

```bash
wrangler tail
```

### Test Worker Directly

You can test your worker directly with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "test"}'
```

## Fallback Mode

Even if the Worker is not deployed, the application now has a fallback mode that provides basic beauty advice based on keywords. This ensures the user experience is not completely broken while you're setting up the backend.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the worker with `wrangler deploy`
2. Add your OpenAI API key with `wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Update the `WORKER_URL` in `script.js`
4. Test the connection
